Here is the rules to write a valid script:

- There must be at least one aircraft.
- Each and every entity must be written on a line ending with a newline.
- Any amount of whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning, between or
  at the end of the parameters is allowed.
- Empty lines are allowed.

Here is how to define an aircraft:

A [DepartureX] [DepartureY] [ArrivalX] [ArrivalY] [Speed] [Delay]

Where:

DepartureX    The center position in the x-axis of the aircraft at the start.
              It must be a positive integer in the range [0; 1920].
DepartureY    The center position in the y-axis of the aircraft at the start.
              It must be a positive integer in the range [0; 1080].
ArrivalX      The center position in the x-axis of the aircraft at the end.
              It must be a positive integer in the range [0; 1920].
ArrivalY      The center position in the y-axis of the aircraft at the end.
              It must be a positive integer in the range [0; 1080].
Speed         The speed of the aircraft in unit per second.
              If you are playing the simulation in 1920x1080, an unit will be a pixel.
              It must be a non-null positive integer fitting in a 32-bit wide representation.
Delay         The delay before the aircraft takes off.
              It must be a positive integer fitting in a 32-bit wide representation.

Here is how to define a tower:

T [PositionX] [PositionY] [Range]

PositionX    The center position in the x-axis of the tower.
             It must be a positive integer in the range [0; 1920]
PositionY    The center Position in the y-axis of the tower.
             It must be a positive integer in the range [0; 1080]
Range        The range of the tower in units.
             If you are playing the simulation in 1920x1080, an unit will be a pixel.
             It must be a non-null positive integer fitting in a 32-bit wide representation.
