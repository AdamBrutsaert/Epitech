# ðŸ«‚ MyTeams
## ðŸš€ How to run the project
After cloning the project, you need run the following commands to compile the project:
```bash
$ make
```

Add the following environment variables to your shell:
```bash
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/libs/myteams/
```

Then, you can run the server with the following command:
```bash
$ ./myteams_server [port]
```

And connect to the server using the client:
```bash
$ ./myteams_cli [ip] [port]
```
## ðŸª² How to debug
You can use the following command to compile the project with the debug flags:
```bash
$ make debug
```
Then you can run the same binaries as before with the `-debug` suffix, here's an example using `gdb`:
```bash
$ gdb ./myteams_server-debug
$ gdb ./myteams_cli-debug
```
You can also use `valgrind` to check for memory leaks:
```bash
$ valgrind ./myteams_server-debug [port]
$ valgrind ./myteams_cli-debug [ip] [port]
```
Or use the vs-code launch configurations to debug the project with the graphical interface.

### 2. Introduction
The **my_teams** project is a simple communication application that
allows users to create teams, send messages, and interact with
other users. The application is composed of a server and a CLI client.

The server is responsible for managing the teams, users, and messages.
It listens for incoming connections from clients and handles the
communication between them.

The CLI client is a simple command-line interface that allows users
to interact with the server. It provides commands to create teams,
send messages, and join teams, among others.

---

### 3. Client

#### 3.1. Overview
The CLI client must be able to connect to the server. Therefore, it
need the server's IP address and port number as arguments when started.

The client is composed of multiple components:

The CLI parser is responsible for parsing the user's input and converting
it into commands that can be used by the command handler (see [3.2.](#32-commands)).

The command handler is responsible for executing the commands received
from the CLI parser. It creates the appropriate packet and sends it to
the server.

The packet handler is responsible for receiving packets from the server
and process them into a format that can be displayed to the user.

#### 3.2. Commands

The client supports the following commands:

- `/help`: Show help message.
- `/login "username"`: Log in with the given username.
- `/logout`: Disconnect the client from the server.
- `/users`: Get the list of all users.
- `/user "user_uuid"`: Get the informations of the requested user.
- `/send "user_uuid" "message"`: Send a message to specified user.
- `/messages "user_uuid"`: Get all messages exchanged with the specified user.
- `/subscribe "team_uuid"`: Subscribe to the specified team events.
- `/unsubscribe "team_uuid"`: Unsubscribe from the specified team.
- `/subscribed ?"team_uuid"`: Get the list of all subscribed teams, or list all users subscribed to a team.
- `/use ?"team_uuid|channel_uuid|thread_uuid"`: Reset the command context, or set the command context to `.._uuid`.
- `/create`: Based on the context, create the sub resource.
- `/list`: Based on the context, list all the sub resources.
- `/info`: Based on the context, list the current resource informations.

Commands are parsed by the CLI parser and sent to the command handler
in the form of a structure containing the command and its arguments:

```c
typedef struct {
    string_t *name;
    vec_t *arguments;
} command_t;
```

The command handler then processes the command and creates the appropriate
packet to send to the server.

#### 3.3. Sending Packets

The client sends packets to the server using the following format:

```c
typedef struct {
    packet_type_t type;
    ... // packet specific fields
} ..._packet_t;
```

Structures are named as follow: `<cl|sv>_(packet_type)_packet_t`
Where packet_type is the type of packet being sent (see [3.4.](#34-client-packet-types)).
And `<cl|sv>` is the origin of the packet *(client or server)*.

This structures are shared between the client and the server along
side with encoding and decoding functions to convert them to and from
a binary format.

#### 3.4. Client Packet Types

The client uses the following packet types:
```
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_USER_LOGGED_IN
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_USER_LOGGED_OUT
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_GET_ALL_USERS
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_GET_USER
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_SEND_PRIVATE_MESSAGE
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_GET_ALL_MESSAGES
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_SUBSCRIBE_TO_TEAM
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_UNSUBSCRIBE_FROM_TEAM
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_LIST_SUBSCRIBED_TEAMS
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_LIST_USERS_SUBSCRIBED_TO_TEAM
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_CREATE_TEAM
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_CREATE_CHANNEL
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_CREATE_THREAD
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_CREATE_REPLY
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_LIST_TEAMS
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_LIST_CHANNELS
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_LIST_THREADS
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_LIST_REPLIES
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_GET_CURRENT_USER_INFO
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_GET_TEAM_INFO
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_GET_CHANNEL_INFO
- PACKET_TYPE_CL_GET_THREAD_INFO
```

#### 3.5. Receiving Packets

The client receives packets from the server using the same format as
the packets sent to the server (see [3.3.](#33-sending-packets)).

Packets are decoded and processed by the packet handler, which then
displays the information to the user.

---

### 4. Server

#### 4.1. Overview

The server is responsible for managing the teams, users, messages, etc.
It listens for incoming connections from clients and handles the
communication between them.

The server receives packets from the clients, decode them and do the
appropriate action(s) based on the packet type.

Send packets to the clients in response to their requests.
Or broadcast packets to all clients connected to the server.

Data is persistent and stored in custom databases.

#### 4.2. Receiving Packets

The server receives packets from the clients using the same format as
the packets sent to the server (see [3.3.](#33-sending-packets)).

Packets are decoded and processed by the server, which then performs
the appropriate action(s) based on the packet type.

#### 4.3. Sending Packets
The server sends packets to the clients using the same format as the
packets sent to the server (see [3.3.](#33-sending-packets)).

Packets are encoded and sent to the clients in response to their requests
or broadcasted to all clients connected to the server.

#### 4.4. Server Packet Types
```
- PACKET_TYPE_SV_USER_LOGGED_IN
- PACKET_TYPE_SV_USER_LOGGED_OUT
- PACKET_TYPE_SV_DISCONNECTION_SUCCESS

### 5. Handbook

#### 5.1. Create a packet

Append to `protocol/include/protocol/codec.h` union the new packet type:

```c
typedef union {
    ...
    cl_<packet_type>_packet_t cl_<packet_type>;
    sv_<packet_type>_packet_t sv_<packet_type>;
} packet_t;
```

Go to `protocol/include/protocol/packet` and create a new file named
`<packet_type>.h` and add two packet structures (see [3.3.](#33-sending-packets)) for
the client and server. And add the definition of the encoding and
decoding functions for both client and server that will be implemented
in the next step.

Then go to `protocol/src/protocol/packet` and create two new files named
`cl_<packet_type>_packet.c` and `sv_<packet_type>_packet.c` and implement
the encoding and decoding functions like so:

```c
void <cl|sv>_<packet_type>_packet_encode(
    <cl|sv>_<packet_type>_packet_t *self,
    packet_t *packet
) { ... }
```

```c
bool <cl|sv>_<packet_type>_packet_decode(
    <cl|sv>_<packet_type>_packet_t *self,
    packet_t *packet
) { return ... }
```

```c
void <cl|sv>_<packet_type>_packet_destroy(
    <cl|sv>_<packet_type>_packet_t *self
)
{
    ...
    deallocate(self);
}
```

You can now append to :

- `protocol/src/protocol/codec/packet_push_cl_sv_packet.c`
- `protocol/src/protocol/codec/packet_pop_cl_sv_packet.c`
- `protocol/src/protocol/codec/cl_sv_packet_destroy.c`

the functions like so :

```c
... handlers[PACKET_TYPE_COUNT] = {
    ...
    [PACKET_TYPE_<cl|sv>_<packet_type>] =
    (cl_sv_packet_<encode|decode|destroy>_t)
    <cl|sv>_<packet_type>_packet_<encode|decode|destroy>,
};
```

#### 5.2. Handle a command

Go to `cli/includes/cli.h` and add to the *Command Handler* section a
function declaration like so:
```c
void cli_handle_<packet_type>_command(cli_t *self, command_t *cmd);
```

Then go to `cli/src/cli/commands/` and create a new file named
`cli_handle_command_<packet_type>.c` and implement the function like so:
```c
void cli_handle_<packet_type>_command(cli_t *self, command_t *cmd)
{
    cl_<packet_type>_packet_t packet;

     ...

    stream_send_packet(self->stream, (cl_sv_packet_t *)&packet);
}
```

Append the function to the `cli/src/cli/cli_handle_input.c` file like so:
```c
static const command_handler_t HANDLERS[PACKET_TYPE_COUNT] = {
    ...
    { "<command_name>", cli_handle_<packet_type>_command },
};
```

#### 5.3. Handle a client packet

Go to `server/includes/client.h` and add to the *Handlers* section a
function declaration like so:
```c
void client_handle_<packet_type>(
    client_t *self,
    packet_t *packet
);
```

Then append to `server/src/client/client_handle_packet.c` your function:
```c
static const packet_handler_t PACKET_HANDLERS[PACKET_TYPE_COUNT] = {
    ...
    [PACKET_TYPE_<cl|sv>_<packet_type>] =
    {true, (void *)client_handle_<packet_type>},
};
```

Lastly, create a new file `server/src/client/handlers/client_handle_<packet_type>.c`:
```c
void client_handle_<packet_type>(
    client_t *self,
    packet_t *packet
) { ... }
```

#### 5.4. Handle a server packet

Go to `cli/include/cli.h` and add to the *Packet Handler* section a
function declaration like so:
```c
void cli_handle_packet_sv_<packet_type>(
    cli_t *self,
    sv_<packe_type>_packet_t *packet
);
```

Then, go to `cli/src/cli/cli_handle_packets.c` and append your function:
```c
static const packet_handler_t HANDLERS[PACKET_TYPE_COUNT] = {
    ...
    [PACKET_TYPE_SV_<packet_type>] =
    (void *)cli_handle_packet_sv_<packet_type>,
};
```

Lastly, implement your function into a new file `cli/src/cli/packets/cli_handle_packet_sv_<packet_type>.c`:
```c
void cli_handle_packet_sv_<packet_type>(
    cli_t *self,
    sv_<packet_type>_packet_t *packet
) { ... }
```
